      <h1>Reflection</h1>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">For Stage Three, we started by meeting up as a group to brainstorm and sketch about the features and implementations of the Grocery Getters app. This proved to be quite useful as it allowed us to come up with a large variety of ideas which helped in visualizing and getting a better understanding of the project. From those sketches, we were able to successfully create an affinity diagram to better categorize all our ideas and decide which would be the most significant towards the app’s purpose. Although it took a few tries and the help of Hessam to explain the process, we were able to create an affinity diagram to narrow down our app’s most important functions in order to make a detailed storyboard. The storyboard went well as we had a much clearer understanding of how we wanted Grocery Getters to operate at that point. Making a storyboard allowed us to better visualize what steps a standard user would go through in order to operate a key feature of our app: creating a grocery list and adding an item to it. From there, we were able to develop a working Low-Fidelity prototype for the Grocery Getters app to simulate how it would function. Finally, we went over a cognitive evaluation of all our user tasks in which we figured out how easily the average users would operate the app. This evaluation in turn helped to refine our prototype as well. Overall, almost everyone in our group participated which made the entire ideation process successful in helping us plan and design our app. The only thing that we would do differently would be to have everyone make more sketches due to the lack of participation of one of our members and to make a more detailed affinity diagram. Doing these things better would have allowed us to get a bigger sample size of ideas to work with and analyze better.</p>
