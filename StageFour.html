      <h1>Stage Four Summary</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The main tasks for Stage Four were to create a high fidelity prototype using Adobe XD and perform heuristic evaluation.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Over the course of our heuristic evaluations we were able to review our overall design and learn about what we did and did not do right. Both evaluators had fairly similar results, finding that Grocery Getters was able to satisfy all of the heuristics to at least some extent. Our app’s design is quite streamlined and provides all the necessary information for a new user to operate it immediately and intuitively. The UI is not cluttered by excess information and clearly displays the actions a user is able perform. Not much error checking was implemented as Grocery Getters is so simple that there is barely any room to make any on the user’s end. In terms of improvement, some icons and texts should be more obvious for the user so those issues were purely cosmetic and could be adjusted. Overall, we determined that we had a fairly minimalist design that could easily be used by any English speaker who has experience using apps.</p>

      <h1>Reflection</h1>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">The overall heuristic evaluation process went smoothly for ensuring that none of the rule of thumbs were violated for our mobile application. The evaluators were able to navigate through the application without any issues and provided the proper feedback needed for the reviewers. In order to help us determine more errors or faults within our application, having a slightly bigger team would have helped us more for the evaluation process. Ideally, having at least five people evaluate the application would be more beneficial in finding more faults but we were limited to only two evaluators and two reviewers. In turn, this made it slightly difficult for the reviewing end to fix potential issues because not that many were pointed out. If we were to do the heuristic evaluation again, having at least five evaluators and at least three reviewers would make the process more realistic.</p>
